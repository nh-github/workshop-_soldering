* plan development for surface mount solder workshop
  capture thought process ``for posterity''
* kit to assemble during workshop
  -* fun/cool when built
  -* not too hard
  --* tech level
  --* part count
  --* graceful failure
      (easier to debug assembly problems)
* board concept
** initial
  -* small (100mm square)
  -* led(s)
  -* uC controlled
  -* coin cell power (CR2032)
** expanded
  -* RGB pixels (4 per board)
  -* interactive (sense hand / motion)
  -* tile-able (edge connectors)
  -* interact when facing (optical data)
* implimentation
  -* 2-3.6V arm (STM32F0)
  -* 5V LED/driver (NO!)
  --* will need to handle 3.3V logic and >3.5V power rail
** brainstorming
*** basic power
   -* use LEDs sparsely (<=50% power, <=8 at a time, average <=25% power)
   -* two coin cells in series (cr2032?)
      LDO from 6V -> 5V, 2nd LDO from there to 3V (uC)
   -* provide USB to 5V rail
   -* high power (>=6V) to first LDO input (manual switch off battery?)
      diode ORing?
*** nicer power
   -* use RGB LEDs with external driver
   -* 3.5V system (maybe 3.3 okay)
   -* SMPS to adjust 2xAA/AAA, Li-Poly, USB, HV to Vsys
   -* addl notation: LT1619ES8, LT3477
      LTspice sim for 1619?
      max draw for cr2032
   -* power input selection (switch, diodes, other)
*** Newer idea
   -* TLC59711 has 3.3V LDO, use it for uC power (25mA limit)
   -* [ALT] external 3.3V LDO
   -* run V_LED at 4-6 V (or maybe up to 12V)
** Design 
*** capabilities/target
    -* 5V in (USB or pin header/phoenix terminal block)
    -* reverse voltage (5.1V zener + PTC)
    -* overvoltage (5.1V zener + PTC)
    -* overcurrent (PTC 1A [?])
    -* float Vin to GND (use 100K resistor [?]) (why: help sense power)
    -* 4.something volts for LEDs
    -* 3.3V for logic + sensors
    -* 
*** how
    -* micro usb for power
    -* pin header for high power connector (combicon, ...?) 
    -* filter power bus to handle slew rate/inrush
    -*
** lights
   -* [SKIP] Adafruit Neopixel (integrated driver)
   -* PCA9622, TLC59711, TLC59108 (x2?)
   -* RGB LEDs (4-PLCC)
      CLV1A-FKB-CJ1M1F1BB7R4S3CT-ND
      TODO: provide testpoints nearby for polarity
** sensors / comms
   -* edge connectors
        $1.2  670-2753-1-ND  SM3ZS067B120AB2R1500 (PCIe M.2 / NGFF)
   -* ir (IRDA and/or IR emitter + IR detector)
   -* temperature
   -* ambient light
   -* IMU (accel, gyro, mag)
   -* gesture sensor
* operation
** flashing/pulsing/animated LEDs
** tiling
** interaction between boards (free space optical, visual, IR)
* TODO:
** edge connectors
   0.1" pin header?
   flat flex?
   SATA
   other?
