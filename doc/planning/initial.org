* plan development for surface mount solder workshop
  capture thought process ``for posterity''
* kit to assemble during workshop 
  -* fun/cool when built 
  -* not too hard 
  --* tech level
  --* part count
  --* graceful failure
      (easier to debug assembly problems)
* board concept 
** initial
  -* small (100mm square)
  -* led(s)
  -* uC controlled
  -* coin cell power (CR2032)
** expansion
  -* smaller (50mm square)
  -* RGB pixels (4[?])
  -* interactive
  -* tile-able (edge connectors)
  -* 2-3.6V arm (STM32F0)
  -* 3V LED/driver (NO!)
  --* will need to handle 3V logic and >3V power rail
* operation
** flashing/pulsing/animated LEDs
** tiling
** interaction between boards (free space optical, visual, IR)
