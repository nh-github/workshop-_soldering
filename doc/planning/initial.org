* plan development for surface mount solder workshop
  capture thought process ``for posterity''
* kit to assemble during workshop 
  -* fun/cool when built 
  -* not too hard 
  --* tech level
  --* part count
  --* graceful failure
      (easier to debug assembly problems)
* board concept 
** initial
  -* small (100mm square)
  -* led(s)
  -* uC controlled
  -* coin cell power (CR2032)
** expanded
  -* RGB pixels (4 per board)
  -* interactive (sense hand / motion)
  -* tile-able (edge connectors)
  -* interact when facing (optical data)
* implimentation
  -* 2-3.6V arm (STM32F0)
  -* 5V LED/driver (NO!)
  --* will need to handle 3V logic and >3V power rail
** basic power
   -* use LEDs sparsely (<=50% power, <=8 at a time, average <=25% power)
   -* two coin cells in series (cr2032?)
      LDO from 6V -> 5V, 2nd LDO from there to 3V (uC)
   -* provide USB to 5V rail
   -* high power (>=6V) to first LDO input (manual switch off battery?)
      diode ORing?
** nicer power
   -* use RGB LEDs with external driver
   -* 3.5V system (maybe 3.3 okay)
   -* SMPS to adjust 2xAA/AAA, Li-Poly, USB, HV to Vsys
   -* addl notation: LT1619ES8, LT3477
** lights
   -* Adafruit Neopixel (integrated driver)
   -* PCA9622, TLC59711, TLC59108 (x2?)
* operation
** flashing/pulsing/animated LEDs
** tiling
** interaction between boards (free space optical, visual, IR)
* TODO:
** edge connectors
   0.1" pin header?
   flat flex?
   SATA
   other?
