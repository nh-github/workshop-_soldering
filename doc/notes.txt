Solder workshop kit:
TODO (2014-08-01):
* remove clutch pin footprint
* create good TH LED footprint
  - (T1-3/4 / 5mm, T1 / 3mm)
  - mark polarity w/ +/- as well
* add second LED (in place of clutch pin?)
* LED(s) below badge clip slot?
* smaller badge clip slot?
  - same width (long side)
  - 50mil smaller (short side)
* try for an edge mount led?
* consider surface mount
  - right angle?
  - board edge?
  - TH pad on edge?
* consider non-square board
  - 2" x 1"
  - 2 in^2 1"x1" w/ 0.5"x2" (``L'')
  - rounded edges
* graphics improvements:
  - logo in soldermask (show copper)
  - logo outline w/ silkscreen
  - fill front of board w/ copper (top)
  - rotate logo (22.5deg / pi/8) ccw (looking down)
* remove some test structures
* machine vision targets:
  - on back (in addition to front)
  - 1mm ring bare of soldermask around metal?
* label battery type
* larger text
  - hicap url is good size
  - cern is okay
* hicap url
  - copper for all?
  - silkscreen for all?
  - silkscreen for some, copper for ``hicap''?
* Contact fab
  - oshpark
  - others, for other colors? 
    + batchpcb
    + 4pcb
    + ``guy who goes to china''
  - non-rectangular board outline (what if it fits with itself?)
  - smooth board edge?
  - interior routing
    + with line?
    + what if there isn't enough space to note ``CUT OUT''?

TODO:
DONE * clutch pin mounting hole
DONE * add open HW logo and vision fiducials
    CERN Open Hardware License?
DONE * check supplies for short run
SKIP * consider how to convert leaded LED packages into j-lead SMD
DONE * check on updated graphics and stuff
DONE: cannot * check ATMega driving LED(s) directly
SKIP * add SMD LED footprints (w/ current limiting resistors)
SKIP * add many LEDs for decoration
